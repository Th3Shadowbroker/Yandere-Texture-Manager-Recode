## YTM-Yandere Texture Manager
![travis-ci-build-status](https://travis-ci.com/Th3Shadowbroker/Yandere-Texture-Manager-Recode.svg?branch=master)

The YTM is a tool to manage custom textures for the yandere simulator.

### Why is it written in ts/js and why is it using electron?
I used electron because I always wanted to try something with javascript/typescript.
So as you might know, this is my first program of this kind (ts/js using electron) so please be kind.

### Build instructions
If you want to build or edit the YTM yourself just clone this repository and execute the **build.cmd** script after executing **npm install**.

### Want to buy me a coffee?

### Updates and new features
I work on most of my projects only during my free time.
I will not maintain them actively, so feel free to fork and create a PR or just create a
whole new YTM distribution if that's permitted by their license.
